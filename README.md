# first_repo_dish 🍽️

Welcome to my very first GitHub repository of 2025. It's a  small but flavorful experiment in scripting, Git, and terminal wizardry. This is where I’m getting my hands dirty (or  buttery?) learning how to whip up simple shell scripts and manage them with Git.

## 📦 What’s Inside

- `brunch.sh` – A script that opens up my Substack.
- `morning_delight.sh` – My first shell script written in the Nano text editor.
- `readme.txt` – An early text file added for practice.

## 🚀 How to Use

To run the scripts, use:

```bash
bash morning_delight.sh
